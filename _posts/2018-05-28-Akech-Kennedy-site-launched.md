Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll] and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be!<img src="/images/config.png" alt="drawing" width="700" height="200"/>.
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Jay')
#=> prints 'Hi, Jay' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
